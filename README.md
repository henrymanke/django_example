# Django Project

This is a basic setup of a Django project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Django project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you are using version control, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

### 2. Set up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, generate one using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a Django Project

If you haven't created the project yet, use the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject .
```

### 5. Update Database Migrations

Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser (Admin)

Create a superuser account to access the Django admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

### 7. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the project by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

### 8. Access Django Admin

To access the Django admin panel, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in using the superuser credentials you created.
